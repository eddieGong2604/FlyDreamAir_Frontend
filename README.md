# FlyDreamAir Frequent Flyer System

FlyDreamAir Frequent Flyer Program is where customers can register and earn frequent flyer points to get discount vouchers for next flights. The system is managed by several administrators who keep track of user records (i.e bookings, vouchers), and take responsibility for resolving enquiries from customers.

The project is built as an assessment deliverable for subject CSIT214 IT Project Management at University of Wollongong
